# Pin
## A productivity app by Mike Bao and Jonathan Huang

To use this app, visit [pin50.herokuapp.com](pin50.herokuapp.com). Or, to run locally on Flask, download our source code and simply type the following commands into your terminal:
```
export FLASK_APP = run.py
flask run
```
Once you enter our app, you can register for an account by clicking on the Register tab at the top. If you already have an account, you can directly click Login and log in with your existing username and password.

Once you log in, you have several options. If you would like to look for existing Pset groups, you can click the Search button from where there will be a list of all existing Pset groups. You can use the Search bar to narrow your results, searching for specific classes.

After viewing the Search page, if you would like to create a new event, you can click on the Create Event button. Then, enter the information about the event you want to create. To enter the start and end times, you can either input these manually or use the dropdown calendar. Once you create the event, it will show up in the Search page.

If at any time, you decide you need to edit or delete one of the events you have created, visit the Manage Events page. Here you will see all of the events you have previously created. Next to each event, there are two buttons: one for Edit and one for Delete. If you choose the edit button, you will be redirected to a page that allows you to change the class, the location, the start time, or the end time. If you choose the delete button, your event will be deleted.
